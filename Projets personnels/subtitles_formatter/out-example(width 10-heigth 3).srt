1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,177
In this
lesson,
we're

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,177
going to
be
talking

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,177
about
finance.
And

4
00:00:06,177 --> 00:00:10,009
one of
the most
important

5
00:00:06,177 --> 00:00:10,009
aspects
of
finance is

6
00:00:06,177 --> 00:00:10,009
interest.

7
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:13,655
When I go
to a bank
or some

8
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:13,655
other
lending
institution

9
00:00:13,655 --> 00:00:17,720
to borrow
money, the
bank is

10
00:00:13,655 --> 00:00:17,720
happy
to give
me that

11
00:00:13,655 --> 00:00:17,720
money. But
then I'm

12
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,480
going to
be paying
the bank

13
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,480
for the
privilege
of using

14
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,480
their
money. And
that

15
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,440
amount of
money that
I pay the

16
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,440
bank is
called
interest.

17
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,440
Likewise,
if I put
money

18
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,220
in a
savings
account or

19
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,220
I purchase
a


20
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,220
certificate
of
deposit,

21
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,220
the bank
just

22
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,800
doesn't
put my
money in a

23
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,800
little box
and leave
it there

24
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,800
until
later.
They take

25
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,822
my money
and lend
it to

26
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,822
someone
else. So
they are

27
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,822
using my
money.

28
00:00:40,822 --> 00:00:44,400
The bank
has to pay
me for the

29
00:00:40,822 --> 00:00:44,400
privilege
of using
my money.

30
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,700
Now what
makes
banks

31
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,700

profitable
is the

32
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,700
rate

33
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,330
that they
charge
people to

34
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,330
use the
bank's
money is

35
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,330
higher
than the
rate that

36
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,330
they

37
00:00:53,510 --> 00:01:00,720
pay
people
like me to

38
00:00:53,510 --> 00:01:00,720
use my
money. The
amount of

39
00:00:53,510 --> 00:01:00,720
interest
that a
person

40
00:00:53,510 --> 00:01:00,720
pays or

41
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,640
earns is
dependent
on three

42
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,640
things.
It's
dependent

43
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,640
on how
much money
is

44
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,640
involved.

45
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:11,300
It's
dependent
upon the

46
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:11,300
rate of
interest
being

47
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:11,300
paid or
the rate
of

48
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:11,300
interest
being

49
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:17,898
charged.
And it's
also

50
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:17,898
dependent
upon
how much

51
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:17,898
time is
involved.
If I have

52
00:01:17,898 --> 00:01:22,730
a loan
and I want
to

53
00:01:17,898 --> 00:01:22,730
decrease
the amount
of

54
00:01:17,898 --> 00:01:22,730
interest
that I'm
going to

55
00:01:17,898 --> 00:01:22,730
pay, then

56
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,040
I'm
either
going to

57
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,040
have to
decrease
how

58
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,040
much
money I
borrow,

59
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,040
I'm going
to have

60
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,420
to borrow
the money
over a

61
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,420
shorter
period
of time,

62
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,420
or I'm
going to
have to

63
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,420
find a

64
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,279
lending
institution
that

65
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,279
charges a
lower
interest

66
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,279
rate. On
the other
hand, if I

67
00:01:37,279 --> 00:01:41,480
want to
earn more
interest

68
00:01:37,279 --> 00:01:41,480
on my

investment,

69
00:01:37,279 --> 00:01:41,480
I'm going
to have to
invest

70
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,860
more
money,
leave the

71
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,860
money in
the
account

72
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,860
for a
longer
period of

73
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,860
time, or

74
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,970
find an
institution
that will

75
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,970
pay
me a
higher

76
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,970
interest
rate.
